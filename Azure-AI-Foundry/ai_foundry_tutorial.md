# üß† Azure AI Foundry Step-by-Step Tutorial

Welcome to your hands-on exploration of **Azure AI Foundry** with the **GPT-4o** model! This step-by-step guide will walk you through launching your first project, experimenting in the Chat Playground and  Assistants Playground.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- **Microsoft Azure account** with access to AI Foundry
- **Resource creation permissions** in your Azure subscription

## üí¨ Section 1: Chat Playground



1. **Prepare an image**
   - Download an image from this folder.
2. Click **Playgrounds** on left panel, select **Try the Chat playground**.

3. In the **Chat Playground**, **attach your image** to the chat input. Prompt GPT-4o with:
    ```
    Write a concise report of what is in my image.
    ```

4. **Customize model instructions or parameters** to see how the responses change:
    - Example model instruction:
    ```
    You are a helpful assistant that explains things in detail for beginners.
    ```
5. **Tune model parameters** in the left control panel:
- **Temperature**: For creative (higher) or precise (lower) responses.
- **Top P**: Another randomness control by limiting the model‚Äôs token choices to a probability mass.
- **Max response**: Caps total tokens in each response.
- **Stop sequences**: Define one or more token sequences where the model should end its output.
6. Reset your chat with the **Clear Chat** button if needed.
7. Use **View Code** to generate sample API request code that mirrors your setup (great for integration into apps or notebooks).

## üõ†Ô∏è Section 2 (Optional): Assistants Playground


1. On the AI Foundry home page, select the **GPT-4o model**, then click **Create an Assistant**.

2. Name your assistant and set its instructions, e.g.:
    ```
    You are a customer support bot for a retail website.
    ```

#### Enhance Your Assistant

##### üîé File Search

- Upload context documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.).
- The assistant uses **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to ground answers in your uploaded content.
- Ideal for policy documents, manuals, or research paper.


##### üß† Code Interpreter (Python Environment)

- Enable **Code Interpreter** to run Python code live in the chat.
- Upload a file and ask:
  ```
  Analyze this CSV and show me a visualization of key trends.
  ```

#####  üß© Functions (Custom API Calling):
- Add external API functions by specifying endpoints and parameter schemas.
- Example: A weather function with `{location, date}` as parameters.
- Call the function from chat:  
  ```
  What‚Äôs the weather in Seattle tomorrow?
  ```
- The LLM model will invoke the function and include the results in the response.

##### ü™µ Logs and History
- View full conversation logs for debugging or iteration.
- Inspect when functions are called, what parameters are passed, and what responses are returned.

##### üß¨ View Code for Deployment
- Like in the chat playground, every assistant has a **View Code** button.
- Use this to export the full assistant logic into a REST or SDK-based workflow.
